# Gumtree UK Offline Task

We welcome you to badly written iOS app ever. We have created a very simple iOS app, filling with as many bugs as possible. You need to tidy up code and make the app ready for distribution. Take this opportunity to show off your coding skills, software development practice and passion in the best way possible. We had lots of fun building (breaking) this project and we hope you have just as much fun fixing it. :) You will find problems range from small bug and untidy code style to major architectural issues, memory leaks, crashes, using old and obsolete API and techniques. 

Attached in this project are screenshots of what the application will display for the list view controller and the detail view controller, when it is bug-free. We believe that good software development practices are heart-and-soul to a good product; and would be delighted if you demonstrate that in your submission. We smile whenever we see good unit tests implemented; get really excited when appropriate design patterns are applied in the solution; This should be a fun exercise, so we want to avoid too much work on your part.

We are also interested to see the decision you make along the way. Please include your response against following questions:

1. What were your priorities and why?
2. If you had more time what would you have handled next? 
3. How long you spent on task? 

Good luck!
